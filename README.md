# My Awesome Project
created a Coin flip game using node


![alt tag](http://placecorgi.com/1200/650)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

used some math methods that come with js so in using those methods i was able to get the same randomizations that you would get if you went into your pockets and started flipping a coin

## Optimizations
if i had more time id like to give this application a nice look to it

## Lessons Learned:

learned the importance of keeping your  code as clean as possible

I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly...
```
